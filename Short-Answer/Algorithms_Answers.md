#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I believe this is linear because increasing n adds one step per n increase


b) This appears to be exponential because every time it increases in the outer 
loop it must complete the full inner loop.


c) this appears to be linear because adding one to n just adds one step.

## Exercise II

 I'd probably go half way up the building and drop one egg.
 if the egg breaks I'd go down to a quarter of the way up 
 the building and drop another one and if it didn't break 
 that time I'd go up by 50% of the amount of floors between
 the floor I'm on and my previous highest floor.
 I would be keeping track of the highest and lowest floors
 I've been on and going up and down by 50% based on if an
 egg breaks when dropped.
 This should be (logn) time.
